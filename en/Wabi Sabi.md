### Wabi Sabi manifesto for today's perfection obsessed world

#### Introduction

I have decided to write down a set of life lessons I have learned by drawing on my experience of living in Japan for three years, studying anthropology of Japan and of East Asia, creating software products and managing lots people for couple of decades, being broke and making good money at the same time. Running on the corporate treadmill and trying to make sense of it.

#### Wabi Sabi

Japanese of yester-year had a beautiful world view that touches the very fabric of one's soul, few people can name it, but everyone understands it when they look at weathered, well-built cabin in the mountains on the flowery spring morning, verdant summer, colorful autumn, or a quiet, snowed-in, winter day. The cabin, the mountains, the nearby stream and forest are all both transient, never to be seem the same way again and comforting at the same time in the feel of permanence. The cabin, build many years ago, is far from plastic factory perfect, yet it is inviting.

The Japanese appreciation of transient nature of things extends far beyond the sense of art and the garden design. This world view, when truly understood, extends to everything we do in our lives. It leads to healthy internal balance, unity with nature, mastery of our actions, thoughtfulness and shelters us from toxic and destructive perfection.

Imperfect meaning of the Wabi is the feeling on has when experiencing the remoteness of nature, word Sabi it the joy of minimalism and simplicity.

#### Positive outlook on things

On the surface, Wabi Sabi, especially when explained thru the lenses of Buddhism, appears nihilistic: "nothing is permanent, nothing is finished, nothing is perfect" -- that is a lot of nothingness, some heavy stuff.  

One way I rather think about Wabi Sabi is by appreciating a full of life flower on the spring morning, perfect for just few days -- we may see it in another life, next year, in the same place and so on for ten thousands lifetimes. Transitional and permanent at the same time. Serving it's purpose to the fullest. No need to get sad, depressed and suicidal. It is time to grow, bloom and serve our purpose and be forever as a part of the chain of life. 

The other way I often think about Wabi Sabi is by visualizing Japanese wood-working tools. Japanese have fondness for some marvelous, sharp as katana sword tools. Their chisels and wood plains are as simple as tools can get, yet they are a true pieces of art at the same time. The tool can be very old and weathered, but it stays as sharp and useful as it did when grandfathers were using it.

I like to surround myself by nature, old tools and antique furniture, not because they are fancy, but because they are simple and have quality lacking in modern plastic disposables.
