### Wabi Sabi manifesto for today's perfection obsessed world

#### Introduction

I have decided to write down a set of life lessons I have learned by drawing on my experience of living in Japan for three years, studying anthropology of Japan and East Asia, creating software products and managing lots people for couple of decades, being broke and making good money at the same time.

#### Wabi Sabi

Japanese of yester-year had a beautiful world view that touches the very fabric of one's soul, few people can name it, but everyone understands it when they look at weathered, well-built cabin in the mountains on the flowery spring morning, verdant summer, colorful autumn, or a quiet, snowed-in, winter day. The cabin, the mountains, the nearby stream and forest are all both transient, never to be seem the same way again and comforting at the same time in the feel of permanence. The cabin, build many years ago, if far from plastic factory perfect, yet it is drawing us in.

The Japanese appreciation of nature and transient nature of things extends far beyond the sense of art and garden design. This world view, when truly understood, extends to everything we do in our lives. It leads to healthy internal balance, unity with nature, mastery of our actions, thoughtfulness and shelters us from toxic and destructive perfection.

#### Not nihilism

On the surface, Wabi Sabi, especially when explained thru the lenses of Buddhism, appears nihilistic: "nothing is permanent, nothing is finished, nothing is perfect", indeed, that is a lot of nothings, heavy stuff.  I rather think about a full of life flower on the spring morning, perfect for few days and then, no more, we will see it in another life, next year in the same place for ten thousands lifetimes. Transitional and permanent in a sense. Serving it's purpose to the fullest. No need to get sad, depressed and suicidal. It is time to grow, bloom and serve our purpose and live forever in the chain of life.
