# Wabi Sabi: the art of living beautifully

## Introduction

There are as many ways to convey a message as they are individuals willing to communicate. Everyone draws on their own experiences. Some people prefer raw statistical facts, others follow religions, some other hop on the latest (Paleo, Gluten Free, No Sugar) trend. 

I chose to wrap my message in the thousand-year-old culture of art, refinement and common sense, a paradigm called "Wabi Sabi" in Japanese. As you read this book, you will experience, hopefully, a paradigm shift and notice that our society, including that of modern Japan, lost something important in recent times. 

Do we really need yet another trend to follow? Yes, if it makes life better and more beautiful. Our brains work well  at finding patterns in otherwise too complex to comprehend world. I could write down a list of thousand "dos and do nots", but the list would be hard to remember. There are other simple to remember one-liners that people follow like "Do not do to others what you would no like them to do to you.", that is great, but it applies to people and does not help us interact with the material world around us. 

I have decided to write down a set of life lessons I have learned. I am drawing on my experience of living for three years in Japan, studying anthropology of East Asia, creating software products, experience of managing lots people for couple of decades, pitfalls of being broke and making good money at the same time. Madness of running on the corporate treadmill and trying to make sense of it all.

## Wabi Sabi

Japanese of yester-year had a beautiful world view that touches the very fabric of one's soul, few people can name it, but everyone can easily understand it when you look at old and weathered, but well-built cabin in the mountains on the flowery spring morning, colorful autumn, or a quiet, snowed-in, winter day. The scenery you see are all both transient, never to be seen the same way again and comforting at the same time in the feel of permanence. The cabin, build years ago, is far from plastic factory perfect, yet it fits in and it is inviting.

Today, when you study Japanese culture and research Wabi Sabi you find references to Zen gardens, atchitecture, tea bowls and ikebana flower arrangements. 

The original Japanese appreciation of transient nature of things extended far beyond the sense of art and the garden design. This world view, when truly understood, extends to everything we do in our lives. It leads to healthy internal balance, unity with nature, empathy, mastery of our actions, thoughtfulness and shelters us from toxic and destructive perfection.

When translated, the imperfect meaning of the Wabi is the elation one has when experiencing the essence of nature. Word Sabi it the joy of proven minimalism and simplicity of things. Together they could be interpreted as "natural simplicity", but I prefer to leave the words untranslated and understand them in the form of images.

This book will be about application of this beautiful, yet powerful world view to every day life, hopefully it will help us to improve our lives and maybe even save the planet.

### Positive, not nihilism

On the surface and unfortunately very commonplace, Wabi Sabi, when explained thru the lenses of Buddhism, appears nihilistic: "nothing is permanent, nothing is finished, nothing is perfect". That amount of nothingness is enough to put off anyone who does not understand the meaning of these words.

I rather think about Wabi Sabi by imagining a full of life flower, perfect as it is only for just few days. We may see this flower in another life, next year, in the same place and then again for thousand lifetimes. It is transitional and permanent at the same time. It is serving it's purpose to the fullest. No need to get sad, depressed or suicidal. It is time to grow, bloom and fulfill our purpose. We we see much about that in this book.

### Wabi Sabi of Japanese woodworking

The other way I like to think about Wabi Sabi is by visualizing Japanese wood-working. 

Japanese master builders are able to make superbly finesse furniture and mega temples without use of nails or glue. These things, after 1000 years, can still be reassembled and put back together for renovation like a puzzle pieces.

To accomplish such feats, Japanese have fondness for some marvelous, sharper as razor tools. Their chisels and wood plains look unassumingly simple, just wood and black steel, yet they are a true pieces of art and technology at the same time. They have soft iron cores and hard cutting steel blades, they have shapes that are just perfect for the specific job. These tools can be very old and weathered, but they are as useful today, as they were when grandfathers were using them. Japanese spend a lot of their time to keep their tools razor sharp which will be another lesson in this book.

I like to surround myself by nature, old useful things and antique furniture, not because they are fancy, but because they are simple and have quality lacking in modern plastic disposables.

#### Imperfection in Wabi Sabi

The concept of imperfection is at the core of meaning of Wabi Sabi. Japanese, over many centuries learned to appreciate ideals of natural simplicity, where especially valuable are objects that have proved to be useful over a very long time.

The closest examples in Western culture that I can think are a pocket knife, swing chair, or golden heirloom grandpa's watch that has been passed over the generations. 

In Japan, the hand made tea bowl with an odd shape, or an intentional imperfections could provide infinitely more value to the connoisseur than a perfect factory specimen. I think, that intuitively we all can understand and appreciate handiwork that is imperfect, yet better than perfect.

Today, we are living in the culture were perfection is a norm and requirement. Perfect grades, plastic perfect body, perfect and newest versions to things we posses. So many of us do not attempt great things because we know we have no shot at perfect execution. 

In fact the saying "Do not let perfect stand in the way of good" is one of the most important things a person should learn. Some of the modern examples of imperfect things that are simply amazing are: 

- Wikipedia, where articles created by everyday people and are never perfect, yet Wikipedia is one of the best creations of humanity. 
- Podcasts are rarely perfect, sometimes there are recorded on shoe string budget in the clothing closet (for sound dampening), or in an event with the live audience stage (Moth, TED, etc.) 

#### Sharpening your tools

Japanese master woodworkers have traditionally maintained a set of some incredible tools. To uninitiated, at the garage sale, these tools would appear as nothing more than few bucks worth of stuff. The experts know that there is hardly anything in the world that could compare to Japanese composite blades. These blades consisted of soft internal cores that allowed bending and of hard outside that kept incredible edges. The shape of the blade was ever so slightly concave to allow for leading edge to be always sharpest when polishing on perfectly flat stone.

At the times when europeans sharpened their tools (and swords) with at best 300 grit stones (often rotating), Japanese spent hours polishing their blades with 6,000 grid flat whetstones.

The effect is that in Europe it was much easier to nail two rough hewn boards together with a rusty nail. 

In Japan a house would be assembled like a puzzle from the pieces that fitted together perfectly. The buildings were earthquake proof and could be disassembled 1,000 years later for renovation.

The lesson of keeping your tools sharp is one of the most important one in life. You do not have to own all tools in the world, but the select few with which you perform your craft have to be sharp.

The first tool that everyone uses is our own brain. There is simply not enough time in a day, even if you have highly intellectual job, to waste it on video games, alcohol drinking, sitcoms, watching sports, romantic novels whatever is your particular poison.

These days with access to Internet us can obtain books, articles, podcasts, video tutorials to develop many mentally challenging hobbies that will constantly sharpen your brain. There is much talk that external hobbies are necessary to be creative your your regular job.

A few years ago I hired a freelance graphic artist who had an old computer which was so slow that some of the Photoshop transformations (filters) were taking 30 minutes or longer. If you decide to be graphic artist and work with Photoshop, you have to obtain a computer fast enough to do your job. 

I have been consistently buying top of the line computers in my career as software developer because you never have time for your computer just spinning wheels. These days, pretty much any new computer if good enough for most of the jobs, except maybe video post processing and related tasks.

#### Being Shrewd with your time

Many people are being shrewd with their money, they really count every cent. Money, however, is a renewable resource, you can be broke at 30 and make a lot by 45, or 55, or 65, time on the other hand is not a renewable resource, once it is gone, it is gone for good. 

I encourage people to become very shrewd with time. Being a consultant I had to keep track of what I am doing to bill the clients. Clients want to be billed only for value being provided to them and they are willing to pay only for the minimum time needed to accomplish the task.

You should use the idea of keeping track of your tasks in personal life as well. It is very easy to waste time, or spend too much time one one task and not the other. I lover to read and reading benefits me, but I have to force myself to take breaks from reading and do some writing, be it book writing, or software. Watching educational movies and listening to podcasts is the same, they are good for you, but if that is the only thing you do you may not make any real progress.



### Steps to success

There are few shortcuts on the way to sucess, for example winning a lottery, having an influential family and friends, attending best schools, or creating a good product early on, will definitely help, but in the long way we have to earn our place in life the hard way, by providing value. 

Having a shortcut may help, but trying to skip some of the important developmental milestones increases your chance to fail, getting discouraged, or worse.

The model provided here has been used for centuries by Japanese craftsmen mastering their art, but it applies superbly to modern academic, startup and corporate world. 

#### Starting from zero

We all start with knowing nothing. There are no geniuses, only people who, had good teachers, have worked very hard and are focused on their goals. It is important to realize this so you do not get discouraged.

I would recommend  "Microbe Hunters" book to every young person, stories of people who knew nothing about microbiology and yet they went on to discover great things. It is important to recognize that you do not have to have knowledge, or proper education, or particular talent to start. 

##### Choosing the direction

At the beginning you may have no idea what to do in life, however you should strive to make best choices anyway. You can consider the following criteria: 

- people will find value in what you are doing
- the career you are choosing is aligned with your core values
- people you will associate yourself with align with your core values

These three points are important, if people are not willing to pay for what you do (e.g. hiking, traveling, writing) than it is a hobby and should be treated as one. People should have hobbies, but these are not jobs and should not be confused. 

On the flip side, you can make a lot of money as lawyer, or a banker, but it might not be aligned with your value system as most money is made in defending interests of worse cases. 

Finally, working with bunch of blood-thirsty vampires may not be the healthiest career choice for young, warm-blooded, person.

#### Apprenticeship: getting experience

Apprenticeship is the stage where you work very, very hard for other people to succeed. 

It sounds terrible, but it is true. You need to serve others to get chance to learn from them. People do not give away their hard-earned skills easily, you have to pay for them one way or the other. 

To gain the experience you could be doing an entry level job, or post/graduate research. Your work may not be necessary creative and you may not have autonomy to make your own decisions. There is a saying in military: "You have to learn how to follow before you can lead." At this stage it is essential to develop a network of mentors to guide you on.

There may be a single apprenticeship path for a craft you are learning, or several combined experiences such as education and time spent in large consulting company where you learn by servicing several clients. It can be also working in several technology startups in the row. 

##### Staying focused

Some careers require a single skill set that you are required to master, for example to apply for position of Android app developer I have to have a mastery over few, very well defined skills, any side-tracking from this path may actually hurt my prospects as employers will see me as not focused, or not dedicated to my craft.

Careers such as Consulting Software Manager require a composite of skills that should include programming, architecture, management, sometimes even things like automotive engineering, depending on the industry you work in. 

Your career goals will dictate what opportunities to take and which to give a pass.

##### Trying, failing and Pivoting

You will make many mistakes along the way, but these mistakes will become very valuable, even necessary to succeed. Also, it is better to make these mistakes as apprentice, then later when you are spending your own, or your investors' money. In startup community, it is considered normal and expected to work insanely long hours and fail few times before getting a lucky break.

In startup community making mistakes and adjusting for them is called "pivoting". Most people imagine this as sharp turns, a total direction changes. I prefer to think about my course as if it was a large freighter ship, unable to make sharp turns. Each pivot is the idea that failed, but each one, after adjustment, moves you forward adding to your experience.  

That experience is your capital which you will trade in for better, more interesting and well paid jobs.

It is absolutely essential that your career development is composed of a lot of attempts at various things related to your field. Many will fail, but without trying you will never get a breakthrough.

##### Exercising your brain

There are plenty of people who do the same thing every day, yet they did not become masters in their field. To become significantly better then the rest you have to push yourself to the unknown territory all the time. Doing same-old, what is comfortable is not growing. Unfortunately, the old military saying "No pain, no gain" is absolutely true, you have to push yourself beyond your comfort zone and keep doing it daily. There is no substitute, or shortcut here.

##### Achieving a cutting-edge in your field

At certain point in your career as a student you will get to the point that you know how to do your tasks very well, you have read all the books and you can guess the next sentence of your teacher, that is a sign that you might be getting close to the cutting edge of your field. This is not mastery yet, but at this point you can start developing opinions of that the next step in your career should be.

#### Getting a lucky break

It you apply yourself, you may happen upon a lucky break, very often in science this happens by mistake, for other people it may be recognition for value you provide and the right conversation at the right time. You have to be skilled enough to recognize such lucky break, to know it matches your goals. You have to have presence of mind and be brave enough to latch to it for dear life.

##### Pursue your passion

The lucky break is followed by even more hard work. At this stage you may be doing creative work and you may have autonomy to make decisions.

Since you have already achieved a cutting edge level in your field, you may be quite aware what are your interests, goals and passions. 

I would suggest to withhold the talk about "purpose in life", life goals and passion until you have achieved this level in order to keep your mind open to opportunities that are not visible early in life.

There is a good chance that from this moment on you can combine your work, your passions and your hobbies into a single "lifestyle".

#### Achieving Mastership

The culmination of your efforts should be that you have developed a career for which you have a passion which arose, often surprisingly from years of mastering the skill set to a point that you became a master and made some discoveries and path of your own. 

At this point you gain following and have your own apprentices, the cycle repeats and culture is moved forward.
