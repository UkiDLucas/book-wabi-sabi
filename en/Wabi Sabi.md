### Wabi Sabi manifesto for today's perfection obsessed world

#### Introduction

There are as many ways to convey a message as they are individuals willing to communicate. Everyone draws on their own experiences. Some people prefer raw statistical facts, others follow religions, some other hop on the latest (Paleo, Gluten Free, No Sugar) trend. 

I chose to wrap my message in the thousand year old culture of art, refinement and common sense, a paradigm called "Wabi Sabi" in Japanese culture. As you read this book, hopefully, you will experience a paradigm shift and notice that our society, including that of modern Japan, lost ourselves in recent times. Do not worry, there is an easy way back. 

Why do we need a pattern to follow? Our brains work well because they are finding simplified patterns in otherwise too complex to comprehend world. I could write down a list of thousand "dos and do nots", but the list would be hard to remember. There are other simple to remember one-liners that people follow like "Do not do to others what you would no like them to do to you.", but unfortunately that applies to people and does not help us interact with the material world around us. 

I have decided to write down a set of life lessons I have learned by drawing on my experience of living for three years in Japan, studying anthropology of East Asia, creating software products, experience of managing lots people for couple of decades, pitfalls of being broke and making good money at the same time. Madness of running on the corporate treadmill and trying to make sense of it.

#### Wabi Sabi

Japanese of yester-year had a beautiful world view that touches the very fabric of one's soul, few people can name it, but everyone can easily understands it when you look at old and weathered, but well-built cabin in the mountains on the flowery spring morning, colorful autumn, or a quiet, snowed-in, winter day. The scenery you see are all both transient, never to be seen the same way again and comforting at the same time in the feel of permanence. The cabin, build years ago, is far from plastic factory perfect, yet it fits in and it is inviting.

Today, when you study Japanese culture and research Wabi Sabi you find references to Zen gardens, atchitecture, tea bowls and ikebana flower arrangements. The Japanese appreciation of transient nature of things extends far beyond the sense of art and the garden design. This world view, when truly understood, extends to everything we do in our lives. It leads to healthy internal balance, unity with nature, empathy, mastery of our actions, thoughtfulness and shelters us from toxic and destructive perfection.

When translated, the imperfect meaning of the Wabi is the elation one has when experiencing the essence of nature. Word Sabi it the joy of proven minimalism and simplicity of things. Together they could be interpreted as "natural simplicity", but I prefer to leave the words untranslated and understand them in the form of images.

This book will be about application of this beautiful, yet powerful world view to every day life, hopefully it will help us to improve our lives and maybe even save the planet.

#### Positive outlook on things

On the surface and unfortunately very commonplace, Wabi Sabi, when explained thru the lenses of Buddhism, appears nihilistic: "nothing is permanent, nothing is finished, nothing is perfect". That amount of nothingness, a really heavy stuff, is enough to put off anyone who does not understand the meaning of these words. Nothing could be further from the truth of the real meaning.

The way I rather think about Wabi Sabi is by appreciating a full of life flower on the spring morning, perfect as it is for just few days. We may see this flower in another life, next year, in the same place and so on for ten thousands lifetimes. It is transitional and permanent at the same time. It is serving it's purpose to the fullest. No need to get sad, depressed or suicidal. It is time to grow, bloom and serve our purpose and be forever a part of the chain of life. 

The other way I often think about Wabi Sabi is by visualizing Japanese wood-working tools. 

Japanese have fondness for some marvelous, sharp as katana sword tools. Their chisels and wood plains look as simple as tools can get, yet they are a true pieces of art and technology at the same time. They have soft iron cores and hard cutting steel blades, they have shapes that are just perfect for the job. Japanese master builders are able to make furniture and whole buildings without use of nails or glue. Japanese spend a lot of their time to keep their tools razor sharp which will be another lesson in this book. These tools can be very old and weathered, but they are as sharp and useful as they did when grandfathers were using it.

I like to surround myself by nature, old useful things and antique furniture, not because they are fancy, but because they are simple and have quality lacking in modern plastic disposables.

#### Perfect social disease

We are living in the modern culture were perfection is a norm and requirement. Perfect grades, perfect body, perfect and newest versions to things we posses. So many of us do not attempt great things because we know we have no shot at perfect execution. 

In fact the saying "Do not let perfect stand in the way of good" is one of the most important things a person should learn. Some of the most brilliant examples of imperfect things that are simply amazing are: 

- Wikipedia, where articles created by people and are never perfect, yet Wikipedia is one of the best creations of humanity. 
- Podcasts are rarely perfect, sometimes there are recorded on shoe string budget in the clothing closet (for sound dampening), or event with the live audience stage (Moth, TED, etc.) 

The concept of imperfection is at the core of meaning of Wabi Sabi. Japanese, over many centuries learned to appreciate rustic and weathered ideals. The tea bowl with irregularity created during the manufacturing process such as finger imprint, out of round shape, or chip could provide more value to the connoisseur than a perfect specimen. We should never be afraid to appreciate beauty of good enough. 

#### Sharpening your tools

Japanese master woodworkers have traditionally maintained a set of some incredible tools. To uninitiated, at the garage sale, these tools would appear as nothing more than few bucks worth of stuff. The experts know that there is hardly anything in the world that could compare to Japanese composite blades. These blades consisted of soft internal cores that allowed bending and of hard outside that kept incredible edges. The shape of the blade was ever so slightly concave to allow for leading edge to be always sharpest when polishing on perfectly flat stone.

At the times when europeans sharpened their tools (and swords) with at best 300 grit stones (often rotating), Japanese spent hours polishing their blades with 6,000 grid flat whetstones.

The effect is that in Europe it was much easier to nail two rough hewn boards together with a rusty nail. 

In Japan a house would be assembled like a puzzle from the pieces that fitted together perfectly. The buildings were earthquake proof and could be disassembled 1,000 years later for renovation.

The lesson of keeping your tools sharp is one of the most important one in life. You do not have to own all tools in the world, but the select few with which you perform your craft have to be sharp.

The first tool that everyone uses is our own brain. There is simply not enough time in a day, even if you have highly intellectual job, to waste it on video games, alcohol drinking, sitcoms, watching sports, romantic novels whatever is your particular poison.

These days with access to Internet us can obtain books, articles, podcasts, video tutorials to develop many mentally challenging hobbies that will constantly sharpen your brain. There is much talk that external hobbies are necessary to be creative your your regular job.

A few years ago I hired a freelance graphic artist who had an old computer which was so slow that some of the Photoshop transformations (filters) were taking 30 minutes or longer. If you decide to be graphic artist and work with Photoshop, you have to obtain a computer fast enough to do your job. 

I have been consistently buying top of the line computers in my career as software developer because you never have time for your computer just spinning wheels. These days, pretty much any new computer if good enough for most of the jobs, except maybe video post processing and related tasks.

#### Being Shrewd with your time

Many people are being shrewd with their money, they really count every cent. Money, however, is a renewable resource, you can be broke at 30 and make a lot by 45, or 55, or 65, time on the other hand is not a renewable resource, once it is gone, it is gone for good. 

I encourage people to become very shrewd with time. Being a consultant I had to keep track of what I am doing to bill the clients. Clients want to be billed only for value being provided to them and they are willing to pay only for the minimum time needed to accomplish the task.

You should use the idea of keeping track of your tasks in personal life as well. It is very easy to waste time, or spend too much time one one task and not the other. I lover to read and reading benefits me, but I have to force myself to take breaks from reading and do some writing, be it book writing, or software. Watching educational movies and listening to podcasts is the same, they are good for you, but if that is the only thing you do you may not make any real progress.



#### Steps to success

In this section I will describe stages a person should go in order to achieve success. Many people skip important milestones and get discouraged, or worse. There are many different ways to success and some shortcuts (i.e. winning lottery, having an influential family, best schools, or lucky product early on), but mostly the rest of us have to earn their place in life. 

##### Starting from zero

We all start with knowing nothing, it is important to realize it, so people who start do not get discouraged. A book that made huge impression on me was "Microbe Hunters", stories of people who knew nothing about microbiology and yet they went on to discover great things. It is important to recognize at this stage that you do not have to have knowledge, or education or particular talent to start. 

At beginning you may have no idea what to do in life, but you should strive to make you choices best you can based on the following criteria: 

- people will pay for what you do if you apply yourself
- the career you are choosing is aligning with your values
- people you will work with are nice

These three points are important, if people are not willing to pay for what you do (e.g. hiking, traveling, writing) than it is a hobby and should be treated as one. You can make a lot of money as lawyer, or a banker, but it might not be aligned with your value system as most money is made in defending interests of worse cases. Finally, working with bunch of blood thirst vampires may not be the healthiest career choice for young, warm-blooded, person.

The next stage is hard work, I call it apprenticeship phase. On this stage you have to show strong will to serve others in order to learn your craft well. The work may not be creative and you may not have autonomy to make decisions, you make sacrifices to learn the craft. You will make many mistakes in this stage, but these mistakes will become valuable, even necessary.

 The next stage is to happen upon a lucky break, very often in science this happens by mistake. You have to be trained enough to recognize such lucky break and latch to it.

The lucky break is followed by more hard work. At this stage you are going creative work and you have autonomy to make decision.

The culmination it that you develop a passion out of years of mastering the craft to a point that you developed a unique skills and discoveries of your own. At this point you gain following and have your own apprentices.
